QUESTION: After threading is added to threads.cpp, is the order of prime numbers found in primes_threads.txt the same or different than in primes.txt?  Why?

    Not always. The threads have their own jobs and do them in an unreliable order.

QUESTION: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

    No, a computer can only support a certain number of threads. Threads can slow down programs that require user input.    

QUESTION: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

    Yes, there is overhead required for managing threads.
